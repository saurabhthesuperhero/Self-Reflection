## Open yourself

Im not feeling good.

Im feeling hurt, there are areas in life where I am so weak and others are handling me if they dont I must he destroyed.

My some areas of life are just together and not in pieces because of roles of beautiful people in some dark situations where I failed miserably.

But When I look in surrounding, mostly Im sad like when I open eyes and see cause family is only connected with world and world is not sweet , actually still yes this 90's boy have locked himself from world.

I m away from world have shield of family and they want me to be out in world to change but somehow still tried my best to be in comfort nut shell, for me its not just shell or comfort but, its like m damn long way away from this scary world I see.

I see greed ! I see ego  ! I see peoples actions and voices or non-actions with will to dominate or show they are high and every thing and not far away guys its always near by you to see this.

How to react ? I just feel shitty about it and feels what the hell is this and what they will achieve in my terms its lack of real knowledge makes you will to dominate or show your higher than someone.

I see people use benefits of someone in situation such as troubles for their  own benefit and sometimes partially,

I see selfish and greedy actions and before anger comes in pity feeling. and after anger again comes the pity feeling and the last pityness is for myself for my stoned actions.

I see myself sometime in better position when I look back How much i traveled but with present eyes I see myself uncomfortable here or there or everywhere, I see imagine myself not a good fit anywhere.

If i say im not a good fit to this block and if i try to find some answer in books/articles/internet I see some self-good feelings lines such as "we everyone are unique pieces and we are not made to fit anywhere ". Is that statement wrong? or does it matter? Just look at your life if you feel you are okay currently what situation you are free relaxed and well mentally ignore this or else if not what can you do? ignore it.

is this negative feelins filled post? if you think then my mind is n that state now but for me currenly my mind looks like  a lake aaaah no not upper view, its deep inside where all the mud has been collected in onespot (yeah its not clear lake) where I am? i dont know but I can see from inside maybe I m inside it. yeah it doesnt touch me anything but how far? What i need to do to live have to connect with this mud maybe walk underneath this muddy lake or swim will I be durty? thats what I am avoiding

So do I feel Im pure ? certainly not, Then why I think i will get affected by dirt? maybe there are somethinhs (many) that i didnt let me enter in myself I see that in surround, i stayed stone , I covered my ears I try to not listen and nothing goes in my brain is my struggle , i close my eyes, my mouth yeah it opens  sometimes but found myself spitting more than i drink my nose : its suffocation dont breathe much feels like darknes is going in, for body always covered with evrything i can like waterproof raincoat so no water in this lake should touch me.
