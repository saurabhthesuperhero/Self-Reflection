## <mark>Thinking Gap</mark>

#### Issue:

Using instagram and scrolling my thinking stopped or ignored and remember later or sometime never.

#### Areas affected:

My mind peace, My tasks which include daily life tasks, also thinking as a work I assume and caught up in something I was not interested. The post affects mentally ofcourse  its depend what I follow but current situation is if xyz meme channel will show you whatever they have been paid for. So emotinally in total different zone.

#### Action:

Deleted Instagram. 

#### Q&A:

##### Q.Why it matters? :

 because are we ready for sudden state of emotinal change? dont emotions last ? you are  happy at this moment sad at another in withought mobile life what is time interval between those moments? ofcourse not a split of second! Now you want to complete all the posts should be read, your reading speed is so fast you read in less than 1.5 seconds and check with number  of posts.Your emotions thoughts they are not ready for this change. 

##### Q.Why you deleted ? :

tried many options to control its my personal choice to delete for everyone it hits differnet but just answer my quesion How much IQ you increase by reading all this?.

##### Q.We need refreshment, then why?:

You need refreshment agree, but How much and with what? and after scrolling instgram posts, stories ,reels R u refreshed or tired?

and how much time? 10 minutes fine but more than 30 minutes really?

and if in actual if you open your app usages its more than 3-4 hour its surely not an refreshment!

Now compare 10 years ago , what is refreshment? A newspaper with hardly one column with 5 jokes maybe 10! or some monthly edition comic book will give some 100 jokes, and Nowadays how much memes , jokes you consume per day? maybe 100+!

R you really getting refresh or its just another work of exhaustment! Do you feel lighter? or heavier/ drained??

## <mark>Tired/Exhaust vs Lots of things in mind to doÂ </mark>

#### Issue:

Exhausting day at work slept less last night its evening 7pm now, having few things to do eg: study about new concepts, brainstorm few ideas.

#### What i did?

- I was too sleepy I were getting close even it was evening time i got my bed sheets and slept but no not able to sleep silently even with silence all over house.
- thinking about whats left to do, what i dont know , about new sprint/week how will go and what will happen tomorrow if/else of evreything and every action of me.
- Launch TV played anime with half close eyes no interest closed it, played youtube no interest no interesy anywhere still thinking of new concepts i added in my list
- tried reading new concepts no point at 11 pm and gave up 
- plan to sleep at 11pm today dinner was over too early but no i wasted time till 1am and slept late too.

#### Result?

- no rest, no sleep, slept late
- waste of time of-course
- no study, no brainstorming
- just scrawleed mobile TV - watched nothing 

#### where I go wrong?

> ##### Understanding Difference between need and wants to do 

- **So honestly what was need?**
  - sleep/rest
- **But I tried sleeping right ? then what goes wrong?**
  - your mind was at one direction? why not! you were sleeping but thinking dispersly to every other things no focus at all!
- **Then isnt other tasks my priority?**
  - can u use ur mobile withought charging? what if lots of apps open and now you are filling your payment trasnation form due to other apps you failed this important one, then whats go wrong? the stuff which was not necessary took energy and in first case not charged. So your body need energy sleep man , also if u doing something focus remove others or it will be shalow eiter work or rest too!

#### what should be ideal from next time?

##### make a List:

- make a list of everything in your mind whatever you have to do
- add sleep rest as task too!

##### add priority and need flags

- order your list with respect to priority of them
- filter what is needed now most

##### allocate time

- do whats needed first 
- give gaps too!
- allocate genuine time to all tasks not what will look good to your eyes, add acheivable timeline
  - to allocate time break down tasks in shorter 30 minutes times

##### follow it

- now just follow your list whatver it is
- now dont think at all ! focus 

##### multitasking=foolishness

> **Say no to multitasking!**

- There is no such thing as multitasking
- also dont do multithreading [thinking about other things in background]
- do whats in your hand now complete focus
- worry doest solve anything if something not in hand let it go
